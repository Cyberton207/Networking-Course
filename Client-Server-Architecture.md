## Client Server Architecture

- The Client-Server Architecture tells you about Servers, Connection between a client and the server and how it takes place.

## Servers

- Servers are the points where a client connects to have a connection for getting/providing a service, to do some task, etc.
- The servers have high upload speed because of what they need to do and their nature.
- The servers of big companies are distributed and they usually do not have only a single server.


## Client

- Client is us, who connects to the server for doing a task or for getting a service.
- Clients have high download speed (as compared to the upload speed).
- When `Client A` wants to connect to `Client B`, then this connection takes place only through the server, I.E.: Gaming.



# Peer to Peer Communication

- The devices gets connected to one another and there is no large server in this architecture.
- This can be scaled very rapidly and is a decentralized network.
