## Transport Layer

- Let's say me and my friend are chatting on a messenger app. I send a message to my friend. This part of transferring that message from me to my friend is done by Networking Layer.
- Transport lies inside the device meaning transferring data inside a single device from the internet.
- The `Networking Layer` transfers data from one device to another.
- Transport Layer takes that data from Networking layer and sends it to the correct application.
- This layer is located on the end devices.

### Flowchart

- This flowchart gives a simple idea of what Transport Layer and Network Layer does and how

- ME => from Country A => Courier Service of A (X) => my parcel travelling from A to B done by someone (Y) => Courier Service of B => Country B => MY FRIEND.

- In the example, X is the Transport Layer and Y is the Network Layer.

### Multiplexer and Demultiplexer

- The transport layer multiplexer is located on the device from where the message/data is being sent and demultiplexer is on the device which receives the sent message.
